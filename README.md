# Pyrk Sentinel

An all-powerful toolset for Pyrk.

Sentinel is an autonomous agent for persisting, processing and automating Pyrk governance objects and tasks, and for expanded functions in upcoming Pyrk releases.

Sentinel is implemented as a Python application that binds to a local version 0.13.0+ pyrkd instance on each Pyrk Masternode.

This guide covers installing Sentinel onto an existing Masternode in Ubuntu 14.04 / 16.04.


## Installation

The following detailed steps are all condensed into ONE easy command that you can take advantage of if your Pyrk Masternode was  previously installed using the scripts provided by the Pyrk community (NB: the script requires you have sudo/root password), or manually using the same installation method as the scripts.

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrkcommunity/sentinel/master/sentinel-one-line-installer.sh && chmod +x sentinel-one-line-installer.sh && ./sentinel-one-line-installer.sh


### 1. Install Prerequisites

Make sure Python version 2.7.x or above is installed:

    python --version

Update system packages and ensure virtualenv is installed:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get -y install python-virtualenv virtualenv


### 2. Install Sentinel

Clone the Sentinel repo and install Python dependencies.
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/pyrkcommunity/sentinel.git sentinel && cd sentinel
    $ virtualenv ./venv
    $ ./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3. Set up Linux Cron / Windows Task Scheduler

#### On Linux:

Set up a crontab entry to call Sentinel every minute:

    $ crontab -e

In the crontab editor, add the lines below, replacing '$HOME/sentinel' to the path where you cloned sentinel to:

    * * * * * cd $HOME/sentinel && SENTINEL_DEBUG=1 ./venv/bin/python bin/sentinel.py >> sentinel.log 2>&1
    
#### On Windows:

Using the “Windows Key“ + “R” to open run and type “taskschd.msc“. This will open Task Scheduler. Program a 1 minute schedule for the sentinel.bat, or `when the computer starts` for the sentinel.exe .

Or from the commandline schedule a windows task for every minute (MINUTE):
`SCHTASKS /Create /U domain\user /P password /SC MINUTE /MO 1 /TN sentinel /TR c:\sentinel\sentinel.bat /ST 00:01 /RU runasuser /RP password`
or using the exe at windows startup (ONSTART) or user logon (ONLOGON):
`SCHTASKS /Create /U domain\user /P password /SC ONSTART /TN sentinel /TR c:\sentinel\sentinel.exe /RU runasuser /RP password`


### 4. Test the Configuration

Test the config by running all tests from the sentinel folder you cloned into

    $ ./venv/bin/py.test ./test

With all tests passing and crontab setup, Sentinel will stay in sync with pyrkd and the installation is complete


## Configuration

An alternative (non-default) path to the `pyrk.conf` file can be specified in `sentinel.conf`:

    pyrk_conf=/path/to/pyrk.conf


## Building

Install pyinstaller `pip install pyinstaller`

Generate output EXE/ELF: `pyinstaller --onefile --paths lib;bin main.py`


## Troubleshooting

To view debug output, set the `SENTINEL_DEBUG` environment variable to anything non-zero, then run the script manually:

    $ SENTINEL_DEBUG=1 ./venv/bin/python bin/sentinel.py

#### On windows:

    set SENTINEL_DEBUG=1
    cd sentinel
    python bin/sentinel.py


## Contributing

Please follow the [Pyrk guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/pyrkcommunity/pyrk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Specifically:

* [Contributor Workflow](https://github.com/pyrkcommunity/pyrk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributor-workflow)

    To contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:

    * Fork repository
    * Create topic branch
    * Commit patches

    In general commits should be atomic and diffs should be easy to read. For this reason do not mix any formatting fixes or code moves with actual code changes.

    Commit messages should be verbose by default, consisting of a short subject line (50 chars max), a blank line and detailed explanatory text as separate paragraph(s); unless the title alone is self-explanatory (like "Corrected typo in main.cpp") then a single title line is sufficient. Commit messages should be helpful to people reading your code in the future, so explain the reasoning for your decisions. Further explanation [here](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
